  <div class="container_col_gray2"></br><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> </div>
  <div class="container_col">
    In response to the current coronavirus outbreak, we are
    creating a comprehensive, publicly available database of the severe acute respiratory
    syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
    that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19). He hope this would be useful to create detailed visualisation tools,
    build a model of the global spread of the virus and potentially inform adequate public policy.
  </div>

  <div class="container_col_gray2"></br><strong>WHAT DATA DO WE HAVE?</strong> </div>
  <div class="container_col">

  <div class="container_col">
    <p>
      We need your help! There are two ways you can help:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you are a developer, we need to develop "fetchers" that collect data
          from machine-readable official sources and feed them into the database
          every day.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you are a clinician or work for a health authority, we need access
          to machine-readable statistics, like Excel sheets, CSV files, APIs etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
